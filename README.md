# gmail_cleaner
Gmail_cleaner is an automated tool to clean your gmail inbox based on specific tabs or a search and can do repetitive deletion of mails. As a failsafe, you can check all the items deleted in your trash folder, to make sure something important isn't there before you finally delete it forever(empty trash).
