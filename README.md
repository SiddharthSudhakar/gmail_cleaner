# gmail_cleaner
Gmail_cleaner is an automated tool to clean your gmail inbox based on specific tabs or a search and can do repetitive deletion of mails. As a failsafe, you can check all the items deleted in your trash folder, to make sure something important isn't there before you finally delete it forever(empty trash).

### Steps to Setup:
1. Clone the Code to location
1. Copy the Selenium Chrome Driver to location:
    - Windows : "C:\\temp\\chromedriver.exe"
    - Ubuntu : "/usr/local/bin/chromedriver"
    - OSX : "/usr/local/bin/chromedriver"
1. python gmail.py
1. (set the configuration inputs as per parameters)
